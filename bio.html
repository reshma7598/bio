            <h2>Biography</h2><br>
            <h5 style="font-size: 12px;line-height: 20px;">Steve Jobs, born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco,
                California, was an iconic figure in the technology industry. Adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, he grew up
                in Mountain View, California, within what would later become known as Silicon Valley. Jobs attended
                Homestead High School in Cupertino, California, where his interest in electronics and computers began to
                emerge. Despite attending Reed College briefly in 1972, he dropped out after just one semester, although
                he continued to audit classes that interested him, such as calligraphy, which later influenced Apple's
                design aesthetic.</h5>
